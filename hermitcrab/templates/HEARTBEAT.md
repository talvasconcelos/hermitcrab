# Heartbeat Tasks

Checked every 30 minutes by the heartbeat service.

**Usage:** Add tasks under "Active Tasks" that you want the agent to work on periodically. If this file has no tasks (only headers/comments), the agent skips the heartbeat check.

## Active Tasks

<!-- Add periodic tasks below this line -->


## Completed

<!-- Move completed tasks here or delete them -->
